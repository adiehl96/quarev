Quartus FPGA Bit Stream Reversal Tool written in python.

# Usage

In a terminal of your choice with python installed, use the following instruction to reverse the bitstream:

On Unix systems you can pipe the output directly into a file like this:

`python rev.py bitstream.ttf > bitstream_reversed.tff`
